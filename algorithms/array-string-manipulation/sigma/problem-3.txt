We define the following:

A palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same forward and
backwards. For example: madam and dad are palindromes, but eva and sam are not.
A subsequence is a group of characters chosen from a list while maintaining
their order. For instance, the subsequences of abc are [a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc]
The score of string s is the maximum product of two non-overlapping palindromic
 subsequences of s that we'll refer to as a and b. In other words,
 score(s) = max(length(a) × length(b)).
There may be multiple ways to choose a and b, but there can't be any overlap
between the two subsequences. For example:

	Index 0123456
	    s attract
Palindromic subsequences are
[a, t, r, c, t, aa, tt, ata, ara, ttt, trt, tat, tct, atta].
 Many of these subsequences overlap, however (e.g. atta and tct).
 The maximum score is obtained using the subsequence
 atta, |atta| = 4 and
|c| or |t| = 1, 4 × 1 = 4.


Function Description

Complete the function getScore in the editor below. The function must return
an integer denoting the maximum possible score of s.



getScore has the following parameter(s):

    s:  a string to process



Constraints

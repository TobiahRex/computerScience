Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].

#3 - MED: Fruits in Basket
Problem Statement
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
you are given two baskets
and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.

The only restriction is that
each basket can have only ONE type of fruit.

You can start with any tree,
but once you have started you can’t skip a tree.

You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

#4 - MED: Longest Substring w/Distinct chars
Problem Statement
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

Example 1:

"araaci"
Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
Example 2:

Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
Example 3:

Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

#5 - HARD: No repeat strings
Problem Statement
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: String="aabccbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring without any repeating characters is "abc".
Example 2:

Input: String="abbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring without any repeating characters is "ab".
Example 3:

Input: String="abccde"
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest substrings without any repeating characters are "abc" & "cde".

#6 - HARD: Permutation in a String
Permutation in a String (hard)
Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, “abc” has the following six permutations:

abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba

If a string has ‘n’ distinct characters it will have n!n! permutations.

Example 1:

Input: String="oidbcaf", Pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "bca" which is a permutation of the given pattern.
Example 2:

Input: String="odicf", Pattern="dc"
Output: false
Explanation: No permutation of the pattern is present in the given string as a substring.
Example 3:

Input: String="bcdxabcdy", Pattern="bcdyabcdx"
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string and the pattern are a permutation of each other.
Example 4:

Input: String="aaacb", Pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "acb" which is a permutation of the given pattern.
Input: String="aaacb", Pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "acb" which is a permutation of the given pattern.

#7 - HARD: String Anagrams
tring Anagrams (hard)
Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Anagram is actually a Permutation of a string. For example, “abc” has the following six anagrams:

abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Example 1:

Input: String="ppqp", Pattern="pq"
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The two anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "pq" and "qp".
Example 2:

Input: String="abbcabc", Pattern="abc"
Output: [2, 3, 4]
Explanation: The three anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "bca", "cab", and "abc".
Input: String="abbcabc", Pattern="abc"
Output: [2, 3, 4]
Explanation: The three anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "bca", "cab", and "abc".

#8 - HARD: Smallest Window containing Substring
Smallest Window containing Substring (hard)
Given a string and a pattern, find the smallest substring in the given string which has all the characters of the given pattern.

Example 1:

Input: String="aabdec", Pattern="abc"
Output: "abdec"
Explanation: The smallest substring having all characters of the pattern is "abdec"
Example 2:

Input: String="abdabca", Pattern="abc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation: The smallest substring having all characters of the pattern is "abc".
Example 3:

Input: String="adcad", Pattern="abc"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring in the given string has all characters of the pattern.
Input: String="adcad", Pattern="abc"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring in the given string has all characters of the pattern.

#9 - HARD: Words Concatenation
Words Concatenation (hard)
Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any overlapping of words. You can assume that all words are of the same length.

Example 1:

Input: String="catfoxcat", Words=["cat", "fox"]
Output: [0, 3]
Explanation: The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".
Example 2:

Input: String="catcatfoxfox", Words=["cat", "fox"]
Output: [3]
Explanation: The only substring containing both the words is "catfox".

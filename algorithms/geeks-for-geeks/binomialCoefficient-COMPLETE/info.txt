Binomial Coefficient | DP-9
Following are common definition of Binomial Coefficients.

A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of X^k in the expansion of (1 + X)^n.
A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order,
that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of
k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set.

The Problem
  Write a function that takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of
  Binomial Coefficient C(n, k). For example, your function should
  return 6 for n = 4 and k = 2, and it should return 10 for n = 5 and k = 2.

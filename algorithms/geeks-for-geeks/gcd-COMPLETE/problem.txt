Given two numbers A and B, find the GCD of those 2 numbers.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers A and B.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the GCD of the two numbers.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= A, B <= 1000

Example:
Input:
98 56
48 18
Output:
14
6

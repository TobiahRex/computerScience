Input:
First line of input contains number of test cases T.
First line of test case contains a positive integer N, size of the array.
Next line contains the array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, print the GCD of array elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= Arr[i] <= 106

Example:
  Input:
    1
    2
    5 10

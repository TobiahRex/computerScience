Write a program to calculate nPr. nPr represents n
permutation r and value of nPr is (n!) / (n-r)!.

Input:
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases.
T test cases follow. First line of the test case will be the value of n and r respectively.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, output will be the value of nPr.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= n,r <= 20
n >= r

Example:
Input:
2
2 1
10 4
Output:
2
5040

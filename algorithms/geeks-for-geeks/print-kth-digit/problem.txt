Given two numbers A and B, find Kth digit from right of A^B.

Input:
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases.
T testcases follow.
Each of the next T lines contains three space separated
positive integers denoting the value of a , b and k respectively.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, output the Kth digit from right of AB in new line.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= A , B <=15
1 <= K <= |totaldigits in AB|

Example:
Input:
2
3 3 1  // a = 3, b = 3, k = 1  - 1st digit from right of 3 * 3
5 2 2
Output:
7
2

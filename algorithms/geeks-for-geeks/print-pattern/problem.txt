You are given a number N.
You need to print the pattern for the given value of N.

for N=2 the pattern will be
2 2 1 1
2 1

for N=3 the pattern will be
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
3 3 2 2 1 1
3 2 1

Input Format:
The first line of input is the number of test cases T.
The T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case is an integer N.

Output Format:
For each test case, in a new line, print the required pattern in a single line .
Note : Instead of printing new line print a "$" without quotes.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to worry about the test cases. Your task is to complete the function printPat which takes one argument 'N' denoting the length of the pattern.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N <= 40

Example:
Input
2
2
3
Output
2 2 1 1 $2 1 $
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 $3 3 2 2 1 1 $3 2 1 $


Note:
The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal 
purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only.
As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from
stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified,
and not to write the full code.

Given the first 2 terms A and B of an Arithmetic Series, tell the Nth term of the series.

Input:
First line contains an integer, the number of test cases 'T'.
T testcases follow. Each test case in its first line should contain
two positive integer A and B(First 2 terms of AP). In the second line of
every test case it contains of an integer N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the Nth term of the Arithmetic Progression.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
-100 <= A <= 100
-100 <= B <= 100
1 <= N <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
2 3
4
1 2
10
Output:
5
10
